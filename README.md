Q1. Two elements whose sum is closest to zero.

An Array of integers is given, both +ve and -ve. You need to find the two elements such that their sum is closest to zero. For the below array, the program should print -80 and 85.

Q2. Find duplicates in O(n) time and O(1) extra space.

Given an array of n elements that contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.

Input : n = 7 and array[] = {1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1} 
Output: 1, 3, 6 
Explanation: The numbers 1 , 3 and 6 appear more than once in the array. 

Input : n = 5 and array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4 ,3} 
Output: 3 
Explanation: The number 3 appears more than once in the array.

Q3. Find the minimum distance between two numbers.

Given an unsorted array arr[] and two numbers x and y, find the minimum distance between x and y in arr[]. The array might also contain duplicates. You may assume that both x and y are different and present in arr[].

Input: arr[] = {1, 2}, x = 1, y = 2 
Output: Minimum distance between 1 and 2 is 1. 
Explanation: 1 is at index 0 and 2 is at index 1, so the distance is 1 

Input: arr[] = {3, 4, 5}, x = 3, y = 5 
Output: Minimum distance between 3 and 5 is 2. 
Explanation:3 is at index 0 and 5 is at index 2, so the distance is 2 

Input: arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 8, 3}, x = 3, y = 6 
Output: Minimum distance between 3 and 6 is 4. 
Explanation:3 is at index 0 and 6 is at index 5, so the distance is 4 

Input: arr[] = {2, 5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 2, 3}, x = 3, y = 2 
Output: Minimum distance between 3 and 2 is 1. 
Explanation:3 is at index 7 and 2 is at index 6, so the distance is 1
